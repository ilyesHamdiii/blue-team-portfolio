# Threat Hunting Exercises

This folder documents proactive threat hunting activities conducted within the lab.

Each hunt is hypothesis-driven rather than alert-driven.

## Structure of a Hunt

- Defined hypothesis
- Data sources examined
- Query logic or methodology
- Observations
- Conclusions
- Recommendations or follow-up actions

## Notes

Hunts may result in either positive findings or no findings.  
Negative results are documented when they provide insight into environment baselines or detection gaps.

The focus is on structured reasoning rather than volume of activity.
