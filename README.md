# Blue Team / SOC Analyst Portfolio

This repository documents the development of practical defensive security skills in a controlled lab environment.  
The focus is on core SOC responsibilities: log analysis, detection engineering, incident response, threat hunting, and basic automation.

The objective is not to showcase isolated exercises, but to demonstrate the ability to operate methodically within a small but functional security monitoring setup.

## Repository Structure

- `soc-lab/`  
  Documentation and configuration of the lab environment used for log collection and alerting.

- `incident-reports/`  
  Structured investigation reports based on simulated security events.

- `detections/`  
  Detection rules developed and tuned using collected log data.

- `threat-hunting/`  
  Hypothesis-driven analysis exercises conducted within the lab environment.

- `scripts/`  
  Supporting automation scripts used during analysis and investigations.

- `labs/`  
  Selected training labs that informed detection and investigative approaches.

## Scope and Approach

All work is performed in a contained lab environment.  
The emphasis is on:

- Clear documentation of investigative reasoning
- Practical detection logic
- Awareness of false positives and limitations
- Reproducibility and structured workflow

This repository is intended to reflect the mindset and documentation standards expected from a junior SOC analyst.
