Project 1 — SOC Home Lab (Foundation)

Goal: Build a functional SOC environment to ingest logs and generate alerts.
Skills demonstrated: SIEM config, endpoint logging, log parsing, Sysmon tuning, understanding of log flows.
Tools: Wazuh/Elastic SIEM, Windows + Sysmon, Linux logging.
Impressiveness: Shows you can create and maintain a mini-SOC environment.
Deliverable: soc-lab/README.md, config files, sample alert screenshots.

Project 2 — Incident Response Reports (Core)

Goal: Demonstrate investigation and documentation of real incidents.
Skills demonstrated: Log analysis, correlation, timelines, decision-making, triage.
Tools: SIEM, log queries, scripts.
Impressiveness: Polished, realistic reports simulate professional SOC work.
Deliverable: 3–4 IR reports in incident-reports/ folder.

Examples of scenarios:

Brute-force authentication attempts

Malware execution (benign test)

Living-off-the-land PowerShell abuse

Optional: suspicious outbound network connection

Key: Include your thought process and limitations.

Project 3 — Detection Engineering (Supporting Signal)

Goal: Create practical alerting rules for the lab environment.
Skills demonstrated: Detection logic, tuning, false-positive management, MITRE mapping.
Tools: SIEM rules, log queries, Sysmon configs.
Impressiveness: Shows analytical judgment beyond rote implementation.
Deliverable: 5–7 detection rules with documentation in detections/ folder.

Project 4 — Threat Hunting (Differentiator)

Goal: Proactively find anomalies or threats based on hypotheses.
Skills demonstrated: Analytical thinking, pattern recognition, investigative process.
Tools: SIEM queries, scripts, logs.
Impressiveness: Rare at intern level; shows you understand the mindset of a professional analyst.
Deliverable: 2–3 threat hunts in threat-hunting/ folder. Include negative results and reasoning.

Project 5 — Automation Scripts (Optional but Valuable)

Goal: Reduce repetitive work and enrich alerts.
Skills demonstrated: Scripting, automation, operational efficiency.
Tools: Python, Bash, PowerShell (small scripts).
Deliverable: 1–2 scripts in scripts/ folder with usage examples.

Project 6 — Labs / Training (Optional)

Goal: Support your IR and detection projects with controlled practice.
Skills demonstrated: Hands-on learning, understanding behaviors, correlation with detections.
Tools: BTLO, HTB Academy, THM blue-team labs.
Deliverable: 3–5 documented labs in labs/ folder. Focus on lessons learned and translation into SOC artifacts.

Important: Labs should never dominate your portfolio — they are evidence, not main content.
