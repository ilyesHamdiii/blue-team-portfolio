# Supporting Training Labs

This folder documents selected blue-team training labs that contributed to detection development and investigative methodology.

---

## Purpose

The labs serve as controlled exercises to better understand attacker behavior, logging artifacts, and defensive responses.

They are included as supporting material rather than as primary portfolio content.

---

## Structure

Each lab write-up includes:

- Objective of the exercise
- Key observations from log analysis
- Relevant artifacts identified
- How the exercise informed detection or incident response improvements

Walkthrough-style solutions are intentionally excluded.
