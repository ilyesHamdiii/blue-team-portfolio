# Detection Engineering

This folder contains detection rules developed within the lab environment.

Each detection is documented beyond simple rule logic. The emphasis is on reasoning, testing, and tuning decisions.

---

## What Each Detection Includes

- Description and intended objective
- Data sources and relevant log fields
- Detection logic and thresholds
- Testing methodology
- False positive considerations
- Known limitations
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping (where applicable)

## Philosophy

The goal is not to generate large numbers of alerts, but to create meaningful and actionable detections that balance sensitivity and noise.

All detections are tied to observed behaviors from lab exercises or threat-hunting activities.
